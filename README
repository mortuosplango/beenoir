Bee Noir is a livecoding game heavily inspired by alJazari[1]

The webserver code is based on polosc[2]

Dependencies:
 - python   v2.6 or newer   http://www.python.org/
 - pyglet   v1.4 or newer   http://pyglet.org/
 - pyOSC                    https://trac.v2.nl/wiki/pyOSC
 - SuperCollider            http://supercollider.sf.net/

How to use it:
 1) start the webserver:
    ./runWeb
 2) start SuperCollider or something else listening on port 57120
 3) start the game:
    ./run


You can receive messages with OSC in e. g. SuperCollider:
    port: 57120

Messages (normalized = between 0 and 1):
    address: /alj/action 
    format: player_id (int), 
        x-position (normalized) (float), 
        y-position (normalized) (float), 
        tile-value (normalized) (float),
        length of the event in seconds (float)

    address: /alj/teleport
    format: player_id (int), 
        x-position (normalized) (float), 
        y-position (normalized) (float), 
        length of the event in seconds (float)

To control a player go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/

For debugging purposes, you can also change the code of a player
by clicking on the code in the game - it will cycle through the 
possibilities forward (left-click), backward (right-click) 
or reset it to 'wait' (middle-click).

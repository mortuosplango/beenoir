Bee Noir is a livecoding game heavily inspired by alJazari[1]

Dependencies:
 - python   v2.6 or newer   http://www.python.org/
 - pyglet   v1.4 or newer   http://pyglet.org/
 - pyOSC                    https://trac.v2.nl/wiki/pyOSC
 - SuperCollider            http://supercollider.sf.net/

How to use it:
 1) start SuperCollider or something else listening on port 57120
 2) start the game:
    ./run
    or
    ./runFullscreen
    or
    ./run80 (HTTP Server listens on port 80 & Fullscreen)


You can receive messages with OSC in e. g. SuperCollider:
    port: 57120

Messages (normalized = between 0 and 1):
 1) /alj/newplayer
 2) /alj/move
 3) /alj/jump
 4) /alj/teleport
 5) /alj/action
    musical action
 6) /alj/playerdeleted
 7) /alj/changetempo

Message Format: 
     1) player_id (int)
     2) x-position (normalized) (float)
     3) y-position (normalized) (float) 
     4) tile-value (normalized) (float)
     5) length of the event in seconds (float)

The length of the event is actually the tick-rate per seconds
and depends on the tempo. Tempo can be infered from length of event.

To control a player go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/

For debugging purposes, you can also change the code of a player
by clicking on the code in the game - it will cycle through the 
possibilities forward (left-click), backward (right-click) 
or reset it to 'wait' (middle-click).

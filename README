Bee Noir is alJazari[1] in python plus hexagons in 2D

the webserver code is based on polosc[2]

dependencies:
 - python	v2.6 or newer	http://www.python.org/
 - pyglet 	v1.4 or newer	http://pyglet.org/
 - pyOSC  	     		https://trac.v2.nl/wiki/pyOSC
 - SuperCollider		http://supercollider.sf.net/

to start:
 1) start the webserver:
    ./runWeb
 2) start SuperCollider or something else listening on port 57120
 3) start the game:
	./run


You can receive actions with OSC in e. g. SuperCollider:
	port: 57120

Messages (normalized = between 0 and 1):
	address: /alj/action 
	format: player_id (int), 
		x-position (normalized) (float), 
		y-position (normalized) (float), 
		tile-value (normalized) (float),
		length of the event in seconds (float)

	address: /alj/teleport
	format: player_id (int), 
		x-position (normalized) (float), 
		y-position (normalized) (float), 
		length of the event in seconds (float)

To control a player go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/

For debugging purposes, you can also change the code of a player
by clicking on the code in the game - it will cycle through the 
possibilities forward (left-click), backward (right-click) 
or reset it to 'wait' (middle-click).
